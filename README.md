# Multi extruder setup on Ender 3.

This project focuses on modifying an of the shelf 3D printer to accomodate multi extruder setup. The main board on the Ender-3 is very limited in terms of expandability and hence, needs to be swapped with a more upgradable one like the MKS Gen L or the SKR Mini E3. This project has used the MKS Gen L.
